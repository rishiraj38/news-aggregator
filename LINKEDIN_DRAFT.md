# LinkedIn Post Draft: The "Comeback" & Helix

## 📝 Option 1: The Personal Narrative (Recommended)

**Headline: From manual reading to autonomous curation: Building Helix.**

It’s been 8 months since I last posted here. An interviewer recently asked me, _"Why did you stop?"_

The truth? I was heads-down learning—exploring new stacks, patterns, and concepts.

Helix is one of the projects that came out of that journey. Here is a look at what I built:

**Here is what I’ve been building:**

Meet **Helix**: An autonomous AI news aggregator that cures information overload.

I realized I was spending more time _finding_ good AI news than actually reading it. So I built an agent to do it for me.

**The Pipeline:**

1.  **Ingest**: Python backend running on GitHub Actions (Cron) scrapes YouTube & Blogs.
2.  **Filter**: An LLM "Curator Agent" reads/ranks content by technical depth.
3.  **Deliver**: High-quality (Score > 80) news is pushed to a Next.js Dashboard & synced via Webhooks.

**The Tech Stack:**

- **Brain**: Python 3.11, OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, Pydantic
- **Face**: Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS
- **Spine**: Neon (Serverless Postgres), Prisma ORM
- **Events**: Clerk Webhooks, Nodemailer

Building this taught me that the real challenge isn't just writing prompts—it's connecting stateful web apps with stateless AI scripts.

I’m back, and I’ll be sharing more of these builds regularly.

## 📝 Option 2: Short & Punchy

**Headline: "Why did you stop posting?"**

That’s what a recruiter asked me recently. It hit home.

I spent the last 8 months deeply focused on upskilling—moving from tutorials to deploying full-stack AI applications. I stayed quiet to focus entirely on the work.

But silence doesn't help anyone.

Today, I’m breaking the silence with **Helix**: My autonomous AI Agent that curates tech news while I sleep.

**What it does:**

- Scrapes YouTube/Web for AI content 24/7.
- Uses LLMs to filter out the noise/clickbait.
- Delivers a verified daily briefing to my dashboard and inbox.

**Tech:** Python, Next.js, Postgres, Webhooks, GitHub Actions.

This is the first of many. I’m back to building in public. 🚀
