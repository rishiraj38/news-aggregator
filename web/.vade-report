# Vercel Web Analytics Configuration

## Summary
Configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js App Router project by updating the import path in the root layout file.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:
- **web/src/app/layout.tsx**: Updated Analytics import to use the Next.js-specific entry point

## Implementation Details

The project already had `@vercel/analytics` (v1.6.1) installed and the `<Analytics />` component was already included in the root layout. However, the import was using `@vercel/analytics/react` instead of the recommended `@vercel/analytics/next` for Next.js App Router projects.

**Change made:**
- Changed `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/react";` to `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";`

The `<Analytics />` component is correctly placed inside the `<body>` tag after the `{children}` element, which is the recommended location for App Router projects.

## Verification

1. ✅ **Dependencies**: The package `@vercel/analytics` is already installed (v1.6.1)
2. ✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: Successful (verified during build attempt)
3. ✅ **Linting**: No linting errors in the modified file
4. ✅ **Placement**: Analytics component is correctly positioned in the root layout

## Notes

- This is an App Router project (uses `src/app` directory structure)
- The Analytics component is wrapped within `ClerkProvider` for authentication
- No new dependencies were needed as the package was already installed
- Using `@vercel/analytics/next` is the recommended approach for Next.js projects as it provides optimizations specific to the Next.js runtime
